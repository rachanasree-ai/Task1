 <p>Cookies are an essential component of a  website theyOsan
    <br>
     Cookie Consent is the <b>industry-leading</b> consent management platform<br>
         <b>(CMP)</b> due to its reliability, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.<br>
          Other CMPs require complex integration work to implement, expert privacy and legal knowledge to use, and hours upon hours of maintenanceâ€”often to deliver imperfect adherence. Osano provides a quick and simple foundation for robust compliance, no matter where your customers are located or what laws protect them. </p>
